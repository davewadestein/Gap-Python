* Recording Policy

_Recordings would be provided as a value-add to training, and are not meant to be utilized as a replacement to the classroom or virtual classroom experience. Recordings will be accessible as “View Only” status and cannot be copied or downloaded. “View Only” access will be provided for seven days, unless other arrangements have been approved by the DevelopIntelligence team. Participants are expected to adhere to the policy and agree that sharing recordings is strictly prohibited. Recordings will not be provided to students who did not attend the scheduled training._
